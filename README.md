- In the "Branch" menu, select the branch that contains your commits.
- From the banner above the list of files click pull request

e. What is the difference between git and GitHub?
Git is a version control system that allows developers to track changes in their code while GitHub is a 
web-based hosting service for git repositories.

f. What does git diff do?
Diffing functions takes two input data sets and outputs the differences between them.
git diff runs a diff function on Git data sources such as commits, branches, files and more.

g. What is the main branch?
The main branch is considered the default branch which contains the original files,codes etc. of a project.

h. Besides our initial commit if it is a new repository, should we directly push our changes directly into the main branch?
No, It is always a best practice to make changes in a separate branch without directly in the main branch.
This will reduce the risk of overwriting other team members' work or loss of work. 
And it helps to revert any undesirable changes made to the original code/data/files.
